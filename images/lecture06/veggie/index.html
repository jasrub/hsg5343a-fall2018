                        <h2>A Lot Of Veggies Are Actually Fruit</h2>
                        <article>
                            <p>The dictionary says that vegetables come from the edible parts of plants, such as the root, stalks, stems, leaves etc. A fruit is a thing that develops from the ovary of a flower on the plant. Going by that definition, all of the following vegetables would then actually be considered a fruit: eggplant, olives, pea pods, cucumber, pumpkin, avocado, capsicum, and zucchini.</p>

                        <h2>The skin usually has the most nutrition</h2>
                        <article>
                            <p>On many fruits and veggies such as carrots, apples, and cucumbers, a good percentage of the nutrition is actually stored in the skin. That means when you peel them, you’re actually peeling away nutritious benefit. The skins also contain a lot of fiber and we’ve already talked about all the great things that fiber can do.</p>

                        <article>
                            <p>The leaves on cauliflower are edible, but they do have a stronger flavor, somewhat similar to collard greens. Instead of throwing them away, you can save them to make stock. Same goes for the stems. Throw them into stocks or cut off the tough outer stem and snack on them</p>
